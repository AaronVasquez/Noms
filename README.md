Food Menus

My first iOS project. I used Foursquare's API to pull in location based menus. I parsed this into UITableViews, where the rows contained the food items.

The detail view of each item on the menu consited of the food items pictures on a home made photo gallery.

The photo gallery is a series of UIScrollViews each containing UIImages, all laid out in series on a top level UIScrollview. I tried to emulate the native Apple photo gallery.
